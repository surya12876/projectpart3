    <h3>prevention tips for avoiding Ciguatera poisoning </h3>
    <p>Preventive efforts include not eating reef fish, not eating high-risk fish such as barracuda, and not eating fish liver, roe, or fish heads.[2] Ciguatoxin has no taste or smell, and cannot be destroyed by conventional cooking.[2] There is no specific treatment for ciguatera fish poisoning once it occurs. Mannitol may be considered, but the evidence supporting its use is not very strong. Gabapentin or amitriptyline may be used to treat some of the symptoms</p>
